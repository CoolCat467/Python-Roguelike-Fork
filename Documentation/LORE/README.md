### Lore

The first idea that i have for an over-arching story is, The main character is a person from here and now. Maybe even someone at UNK (100% ADAM XD), a portal 
opens and drops the character + another person/thing (someone they care about, a pet, the device that opened the portal) through into antoher reality, and they
become separated. The character lands in the new reality (old-timie: western, mid-evil. future: space, another planet, another dimension).
The character lands in starting map. chooses exit to go to new maps, after completing x number of maps, gets to final boss map. boss is standing between player
and the person/thing that came with them, and the portal to go home. defeat boss to win game and go home.
