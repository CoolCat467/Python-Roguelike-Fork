# Daily Updates
Publish a short summary of the work you have completed each day.

This will make it much easier for me (Nova) to keep our documentation in order.

# Template
## Filename
`[YYYY]-[MM]-[DD]_summary.md`

Example:
`2025-04-21_summary.md`

## File Contents
```
# [date] updates
- bulleted list of things you have done
- can be as verbose or as susinct as you like

Can also be a summary of work done in narrative-form. Sentances and whatnot.
```
