# Statement of Work
### Project Objectives
- Create a fully functional two-dimentional roleplay game
- Include a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Include multiple "levels" that the game will progress through
- Include background music

### Project Scope
The scope of our project is to create a roleplay game with a GUI displaying a top-down view, grid/tile-based levels, pixel art, background music, enemies, a final boss, and various game items. We will NOT be creating a game that takes multiple hours of progression to fully complete, multiplayer interaction, or internet connectivity.

### Team Expectations
As a team, we expect to develop a fully functional two-dimentional roleplay game with a main plot line, multiple "levels" to progress through, and minimal bugs/errors.
