# Executive Summary
The problem we are trying to solve is eliminating boredom, stress, and restlessness by utilizing entertainment. The process we are taking to resolve this issue is developing a roleplay video game with its design based off of the original Legend of Zelda game. We will be creating a main menu, various map features, background music, and other elements common in retro two-dimensional roleplay games. Our proposed solution is one that will accommodate players of all ages who wish to relax after a long day, on a weekend, or when visiting friends and family. Our primary expected deliverable is our roleplay game that will be gradually developed throughout this project.
