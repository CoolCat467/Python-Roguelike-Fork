# Problem Statement
Our project aims to solve problems related to boredom, stress, and/or a lack of entertainment for the average person. By resolving these issues, we hope to provide a fun roleplay-style video game where the user can spend their free time exploring various "levels", items, and ultimately defeating a final boss.
