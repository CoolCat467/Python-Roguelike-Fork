# Maintenance Overview

The purpose of performing maintenance on this project is to fix various bugs and performance issues users experience while playing the video game. Additionally, new features and game elements must be added to create interest from seasoned players of the game.

The following types of maintenance will be conducted throughout the software's lifecycle:
- Corrective: fixing any bugs, errors, and glitches that are experienced during gameplay
- Adaptive: allowing the game to remain functional on new, updated, and improved hardware/software environments
- Perfective: constantly improve the performance of the game to maintain an acceptable level of operability
- Preventive: implementing fixes to potential issues, resolving security vulnerabilities, and supporting new computing environments before the become popular enough to cause noticable problems during gameplay

We will conduct regular testing on our programs to ensure they function as intended. These will be completed before the presentation of a new prototype and will be altered if unsuccessful until an adequate level of success has been reached.

Along with any updates/patches to the game, documentation of these changes, processes, and testing will be completed to communicate progress in the game's lifecycle.
