# rough idea
- original legend of zelda type graphics
  - top-down view
  - 2D
  - enemies and player sprites
  - grid/tile-based level design
## graphics
- 2D
- pixel-art
- we make all the art ourselves(!)
  - reccomended software: LibreSprite: https://libresprite.github.io/#!/
## sound design
TRACKER MUSIC
- we make all of the sound assets ourselves
  - background/ambient music
  - SFX (e.g. hit sound, coin-grab sound, transition sound)
- reccomended software: Furnace: https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace
