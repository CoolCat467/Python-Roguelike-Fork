# rough idea
A big ol' doc for what we are aiming for as a final project.

## graphics
- original legend of zelda type graphics
- 2D
- top-down view
- grid/tile-based level design
- pixel-art
- we make all the art ourselves(!)
  - reccomended software: LibreSprite: https://libresprite.github.io/#!/

## sound design
TRACKER MUSIC

RETRO BLEEP BLOOPS

- we make all of the sound assets ourselves
  - background/ambient music
  - SFX (e.g. hit sound, coin-grab sound, transition sound)
- reccomended software: Furnace: https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace

## level design
- Hand-made "milestone" levels
- procedurally-generated "filler" levels between milestone levels
- after each milestone, the tile/grid textures change (think The Binding of Isaac, where the Cellar map comes before the Catacombs which comes before the Depths; [link to see what i'm talking about](https://bindingofisaacrebirth.wiki.gg/wiki/Chapters))
