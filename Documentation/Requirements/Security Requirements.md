# Security Requirements
## Input Validation:
- All input needs to be validated whether it's out of bounds handling, type checking, etc..
- All data with no input or output (yet) has to be null.
- Try and excepts should be used on most if not all validation checks.
- If a try and except fails, display error message to explain why it failed.
- Maybe try to implement a black box function that checks for inputs.

## Unit Tests
- Make sure to try and use unit test from the python libraries to run test.
- Try to create a test with each function (if possible).
- Try to do other ways of unit tests.

## GUI
- Make sure inputs are working correctly.
- Make sure user can't crash the GUI by spamming random characters.
- Make sure user can't break the game.

## OOP Practices
- Make sure variables are private especially since we are dealing with OOP.
- Make sure we use getters and setters.
- Make sure we use default constructors and construtors.
