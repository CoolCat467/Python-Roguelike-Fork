# Security Statement

As a security team lead, we want to make sure our data is as safe as possible. Data being safe is my main priority as the security lead so we'd like to put measures into place to counter these unsafe practices.
- Make sure we use private variables so outsiders can't access code
- Make sure we validate input so we get the correct input into whatever we need
- Make sure GUI syncs with the main code so there isn't any delay or lag between the two
- Make sure to have error checking ex: __private_variable = -1;
- Try and use try and catch exceptions to remove those pesky exceptions

Overall, let's run unit tests and let's create a safe RPG program where the user can't completely break the game! If we manage to follow the following practices then we'll be able to better the user's enjoyment of our lovely game!
We hope to have a great outcome of a fantastic RPG and to do so, we must be able to put security ahead first.
