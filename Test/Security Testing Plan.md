# Security Testing Plan
## Overview
**Week One** - As of right now, we just have a shell of a game with mostly some of the getters and setters actually being set up. As of a result of this, this weeks testing will probably only include some unit tests which test
the successfullness of the setters and getters.

**Week Two** - Our game structure has completely changed and we've decided to scope down a little. As a result of this, we'll be moving onto somethings that are simpler and I'll have to replace and remove some getter and setters testers.

## Plan
**Week One** - To do this, we'll implement a module named "unittest". From this module, it makes the testing of setters and getters straightforward and uncomplicated. We'll do test to get the value from the getters and test it
with the value that it's supposed to return. The same logic will be applied for the setters, but this time we'll set a value and then test it.

**Week Two** - To acomplish this, let's refactor the getters and setters tester to fully match with the code that is in the code database. We'll also start on a blackbox function if we can and then also work on doing some tests on the helpers.

## Results
**Week One** - As of right now, all of the setters and getters work with a 100% success rate. 

**Week Two** - As of 05/02/2025, the getters and setters are fully matched up and I will begin working on some of the other testing.
