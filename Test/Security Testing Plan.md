# Security Testing Plan
## Overview
**Week One** - As of right now, we just have a shell of a game with mostly some of the getters and setters actually being set up. As of a result of this, this weeks testing will probably only include some unit tests which test
the successfullness of the setters and getters.

## Plan
**Week One** - To do this, we'll implement a module named "unittest". From this module, it makes the testing of setters and getters straightforward and uncomplicated. We'll do test to get the value from the getters and test it
with the value that it's supposed to return. The same logic will be applied for the setters, but this time we'll set a value and then test it.

## Results
**Week One** - As of right now, all of the setters and getters work with a 100% success rate. 

#### Note: We'll make sure to add unit tests as we complete each and every function. We'll also try to implement try / catches when a certain class is completed. (Updated as of 04/25/2025 9:33 AM)
