# cybr404project3
Our repository for CYBR 404's third project.

# Project Index
Currently, our project is split between several different branches and is in desperate need of refactoring.

Here's how it's stored currently:
- `main` stores a lot of Gavin's code for procedural level generation, in addition to a lot of our documentation.

## Nova's branches
historical branches: oldest -> newest
- `Tile-Map-Proof-of-Concept` proof of concept for level display functionality.
- `tilemap-proof-2` contains an early prototype for level display expanded from the previous branch.
- `level_editor_v0.1` contains a very limited level editor, evolved from `tilemap-proof-2`, with change-able tiles. The start of OOP implementation for the level editor starts here.

currently being worked on:
- `Level_Editor_v0.2` will have all of the major functionality re-factored into OOP, with much expanded functionality (e.g. persistent maps via file creation, bounding-boxes for each tile for use in collision detection)
