# cybr404project3
Our repository for CYBR 404's third project.

# Project Index
Currently, our project is split between several different branches and is in desperate need of refactoring.

Here's how it's stored currently:
- `main` stores a lot of Gavin's code for procedural level generation, in addition to a lot of our documentation.
- `tilemap-proof-2` contains my (Nova's) code for manual level creation, has plans to expand into a level-creator.
