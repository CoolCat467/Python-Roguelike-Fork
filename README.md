# cybr404project3
Our repository for CYBR 404's third project.

# Project Index

Here's how our code is stored currently:
- Branch `main`
  - Gavin's code for procedural level generation ([`Source/driver.py`](Source/driver.py)).
  - Documentation
  - v0.1 of a level editor (limited functionality) ([`Source/Level_Creator/main.py`](Source/Level_Creator/main.py)).
- Branch `Level_Editor_v0.2`
  - Working branch for version 0.2 of the level editor.
  - Will have all of the major functionality re-factored into OOP, with much expanded functionality (e.g. persistent maps via file creation, bounding-boxes for each tile for use in collision detection.
