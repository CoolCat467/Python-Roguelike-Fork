# Level creator
This has very limited functionality as of release, eventually this will be a fully-fledged level editor and be refactored into OOP principles.

# current functionality: 
- dynamic level display based on reading an array of tile IDs (see grid_instance variable)
- reading mouse pointer position on occurence of click
- key inputs 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0
	- change currentlu selected tile to paint with
- painting tiles with clicking *mostly* works (not entirely, fix in next branch)

# TODO
- finalize functionality for editing tiles
- add functionality for reading and writing map files
	- add `.levelgrid` file parsing capability (see [levelgrid docs](levelgrid_docs.md) for more info)

# ideas for gameplay key-map
## movement
W S A D ðŸ¡º movement
## interaction
<, > ðŸ¡º yes, no; interaction options

/ ðŸ¡º attack? (because it's "slash" for slashing?)

I think it should be keyboard-based, I don't see much reason for the player to click on things.
