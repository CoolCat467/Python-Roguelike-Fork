HOW TO USE .levelgrid FILES

# header
The file starts with a few lines of metadata.
Each line starts with "@" to denote that it is a part of the header.
Properties are in all-caps, key-value pairs separated by 
## @NAME
the name of the level

**use**:
`@NAME:"level 1"`

## @SIZE
the size of the level, in grid squares.

**use**:
`@SIZE:16x16`
